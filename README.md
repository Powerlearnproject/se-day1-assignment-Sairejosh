Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is a systematic and displine aproach to the development,oparation and maintainance of software.
          impotance
  complex systems
  -software are incredibly complex requiring structured
  reliability
  -regorous testing and qualityassuranace to ensure software functions.
  Maintanability
  -well-engeneered practices is esier to maintain ,update,and modify over time.
  Efficiency
  -software engeneering practices optimize resouce utilization and developement process ,leeding to more effective software development.
  cost-Effectivement
  -by reducing errors and ipmroving maintanability ,this helps reduce the ovaral cost of a software developement
  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Structured programming
introductions of structured programming i.e top down design modular
2.Object oriente programming
introductions of concepts like .
encapsulation,inheritance and polymophisim
3.cloud computing
continous delivery(ci/cd) leading to faster release cycle and improved software quality


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1 planing.define the project goals,scope, and requrement.
2.Analysis:anylyzing the requrements to understand the problem and posible slutions.
3.design: creating the architecture, user interface and ovarall design of software.
4.implimantation writting of the actual code based n the design.
5.Testing:verifying that the software meets the requrements and is free of bugs
6.deployement:releasing the softwareto the end users.
7.Maintanance:Providing ongoingsuport,updates,and bug fixes after deployement.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
 Waterfal
1.process:sequencial phases.each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
2.flexibility:low chances are deficult and expensive to impliment once a phase is compleated.
3.Documentation:haevy documents is requred at each stage.
4.appropriate scenarios: project with well define requrements,stable technologyand low tolerance of changes.
  Agile
 1. process:deve is broken into smaller circle
 2. Flexibility canges are easly accomodatedthroughout the development process
    Apropriate scenariosproject with evolving requrements,uncertain,technologies and a need for rapidfeedbackeg. web applictions.
     


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.software developer.
- writes code to impliment software features
- debug and troubbleshoots code
2.Quality assuarance(QA)
-Design and execute test pans
-Ensures software quality.
3.Project manager:
  -plans and manages project timelines and resources communicate with stakeholdes.
  -communicates with stakeholders
  -Ensures the project i complete on time.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's
-provides tools for coding ,debugging and testing.
-increase developer productivity.
i.e visual studio
VCS:
-Track changes to code over time.
-Enebles colaboration among colaboration among developers.
-code backups and recovery i.e git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.keeping up with technology.
-learn new technologies and frameworks
2.debuging complex issues: 
use debugingtools breakedownproblems into smaller parts and collaborates with others.
3.Meeting deadlines 
prioritize tasks,mnages time effectivlyand communicate progress regularly.
4.Working eith legacy codes
Refactor code ,write tests and document changes.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing:testing individual componnts
Ensure that each part of the code is working as expected.
2.Intergration Testing:
Testing the interactions between diffrent components or modules. 
verify that they work together correctly.
3.system esting
-testing the entire system as a whole.
-ensures that the system meets specified requrements. 
4. AcceptanceTesting:
-Testing  the system from end users perspective.
-verify that the system meet the users needs and expectation

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
